              <li>
                <h4>Did you know?</h4>
                <p> Saturn's beautiful rings are not solid. They are made up of particles of ice, dust and rock -- some as tiny as grains of sand, some much larger than skyscrapers.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Did you know?</h4>
                <p>Four days after it was launched, the Deep Space 1 spacecraft was about 1,000,000 kilometers (about 600,000 miles) from Earth. To fly that far in a jet, you would have to fly for 6 weeks without stopping!</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Did you know?</h4>
                <p>To communicate with distant spacecraft, NASA's Deep Space Network uses antenna with a diameter of up to 70 meters (230 feet). That is almost as big as a football field.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Did you know?</h4>
                <p> Galileo, launched in 1989, was the first U.S. spacecraft to orbit Jupiter. Galileo entered Jupiter's orbit in 1995.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Did you know?</h4>
                <p>It's a small world. More than 1,000 Earths would fit into Jupiter's vast sphere.</p>
              </li>
              <img src="images/photos/universe-2.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
              <li>
                <h4>Did you know?</h4>
                <p> It's pretty windy on Saturn. Winds around the planet's equator can reach 1,800 kilometers (1,118 miles) per hour. In comparison, the fastest winds on Earth reach only about 400 kilometers (about 250 miles) per hour.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Did you know?</h4>
                <p>Scientists are particularly interested in Saturn's moon Titan because it's one of the few known moons with its own dense atmosphere. Titan's atmosphere is also thought to be very similar to what Earth's atmosphere was a long time ago. By learning about Titan, we'll learn about our own planet.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Did you know?</h4>
                <p>Although other planets have rings too, Saturn's rings are the only ones that are visible from Earth even with a small telescope.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Did you know?</h4>
                <p>Equinox literally means "equal night." On an equinox, the sun is above the equator, so both the northern and southern hemispheres of the Earth receive about the same amount of sunlight, and day and night are the same length.</p>
              </li>
              <img src="images/photos/saturn.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
              <li>
                <h4>Did you know?</h4>
                <p>Because Saturn is tilted, when its rings are facing Earth edge-on they "disappear" from our view. We now know this happens every 14 years or so, but poor Galileo questioned his sanity when they "disappeared" and then "reappeared" a few years later.</p>
